## **MLOps with DVC and Amazon S3

This repository contains a subproject dedicated to implementing MLOps practices using DVC for data versioning and Amazon S3 for data storage. The goal of this project is to streamline the machine learning lifecycle by ensuring reproducibility, scalability, and efficient data management.

# **Project Overview

This subproject focuses on:
	•	Setting up and managing a data pipeline with DVC.
Streamline the handling of large datasets with DVC’s efficient tracking and version control.
	•	Storing and versioning datasets in Amazon S3.
Leverage cloud storage to maintain dataset accessibility and scalability.
	•	Automating workflows for machine learning models.
Enable reproducible pipelines for training, evaluation, and deployment.

Features
	•	Data Versioning: Track and manage changes to datasets using DVC.
	•	Cloud Storage: Utilize Amazon S3 for secure and scalable dataset storage.
	•	Reproducible Pipelines: Automate key stages of the ML lifecycle, from data preparation to model deployment.
